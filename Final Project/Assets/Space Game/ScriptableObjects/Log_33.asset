  logText: 'I am temporarily stranded on F-14-X. Not due to any malfunction, or even
    permits, but due to the festival they have at present. The bird population makes
    a migration and sheds pink feathers that rain from the sky at this time of year.
    Thus, no ships are permitted to travel on or off planet until the festival is
    over.  '
