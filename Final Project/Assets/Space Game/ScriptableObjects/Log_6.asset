    I had good enough reception to call my parents from here though. They''re both
    well, and I let them know that I will be bringing them back a little surprise.
    What they don''t know is that it''s a vintage of belladona lace wine - the same
    vintage and kind as the one they had at their wedding. I may not be back until
    after their solarversus day, but I hope they like it anyways.  '
