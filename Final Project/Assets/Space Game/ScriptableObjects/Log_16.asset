  logText: 'This week it was necessary to restock my rations. They aren''t made the
    same everywhere in this quadrant, and the batch I picked up is particularly bad,
    unfortunately. Even rehydrated, these rations have the texture of soggy styrofoam
    mixed with zillian bean pudding, but with no taste whatsoever except the liquid
    they''ve been rehydrated in. An adequate source of nutrients and nourishment,
    but my tongue has never been more unhappy.  '
