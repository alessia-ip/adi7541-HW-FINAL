  logText: I am regretting my choice of entertainment for this voyage. There is only
    so many times I can listen to the same song on one trip. For later reference,
    said song is 'Starlight Aurora' by Galactic Treble. NEWLINE NEWLINE It's a very
    good song, but I will need a couple months before I can listen to this again.
    For now, I will resort to radio frequencies at various outposts. It is a hit
    or miss experience. Right now, the outpost is playing what can only be described
    as a crunkcore with antique stylophones. Someone must enjoy this music, but it
    isn't for me. I'll stick to 'Starlight Aurora'.
