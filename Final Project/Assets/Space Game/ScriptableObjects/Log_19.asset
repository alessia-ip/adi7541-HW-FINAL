  logText: 'For a few days, I have been out of action and confined to bed until now.
    It seems I have come down with my first case of space-sickness in the past five
    years. The toll travel takes on one''s body is undeniable. I will spare the unsavoury
    details, but adjusting the pressure and grav simulations seemed to have temporarily
    alleviated the symptoms, enough for me to be able to land and wait it out. I
    set out again today to continue my search.  '
