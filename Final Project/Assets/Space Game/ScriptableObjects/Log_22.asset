  logText: You would think, in the expanse of space, that traffic does not exist.
    Those who have never left their homes are often under this misconception. I feel
    compelled to say it isn't true. I am stuck in traffic at this very moment - this
    laneway is heavily populated at this time of year as a pilgrimige is made across
    the stars to bear witness to the alignment of the planets in phi-seven-four.
    Every solar cycle they align but once. By the standards of the universal cycle
    however, that only happens once every seven cycles. NEWLINE NEWLINE It makes
    for incredible congestion in and out of the system however, and it is putting
    me severely behind schedule.
