  logText: I took a pitstop to refuel here on planet T-12-L and do maintenance. The
    port here seems to be known for its handicrafts using a rare lavender mineral
    that is found on this planet. NEWLINE NEWLINE It does not help my search, but
    I now have a set of matching earrings made from the metal.
