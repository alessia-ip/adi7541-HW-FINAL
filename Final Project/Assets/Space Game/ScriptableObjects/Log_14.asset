  logTitle: 'Log Date: 1-M NUM'
  logText: I have a new mouth to feed now. Having stopped on Z-6 in the Zeta-Gamma-Five
    system, I have come across a stray zirician house-cat. Unlike the wild counterparts,
    this tiny furball was very, very friendly, and stranded in the middle of the
    docks. Obviously she is coming with me, and I have decided to name her Lieutenant
    Fuzzypaws. She will make an excellent companion on my flights, and an excellent
    second in command aboard my ship.
