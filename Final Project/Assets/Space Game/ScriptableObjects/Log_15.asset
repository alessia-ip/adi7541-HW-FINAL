  logText: I needed some extra help upon reaching Sigma-Six. It's meteor season here,
    and my hull was clipped by one that I misjudged the trajectory of. It seems I
    have acquired a bot because of it. Initially I intended only to hire the bot
    to perform the necessary duties, but they've proven very useful, technically
    skilled, and are sufficiently witty. I can't say I mind the sass, so they are
    now a permanent memeber of my ship crew.
