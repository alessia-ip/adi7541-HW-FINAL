  logTitle: 'Log Date: 1-M NUM'
  logText: Still no sign of the missing ship or its crew. There is a much older wreck
    in this system, overrun by what have been affectionately dubbed metal-mites.
    Less affectionately is recognizing the damage they do. They'll chew holes in
    a hull in a manner of days, and I have no intention of becoming the next victim
    of this infestation.
