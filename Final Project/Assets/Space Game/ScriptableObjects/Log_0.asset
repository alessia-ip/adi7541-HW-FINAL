  logText: 'I''ve had a malfunction while near the outer moon. Seems this system
    has peculiar magnetic fluctuations. I''ve wasted a day and a half on repairs
    before the sub-light engine was working again. NEWLINE NEWLINE Doing one loop
    around the system for good measure, there is nothing of note. There''s a small
    mining colony on one of the inner moons, around planet V-V-Four, but they report
    that no-one has passed through since last month''s shift rotation. NEWLINE NEWLINE
    It''s going to take longer than a month for me to get all the dust out of the
    vents. '
